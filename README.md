## Pre-Processing

- All processing is handled by the `process_files()` function. To view the processed files look in the `data/processed`
  after running the program.

## Running the Program

- To run the program ensure you are in the project folder, and run the script using `python3 main.py`.
- The `calculate_meta_features()` function is responsible for determining all the values of the document vectors and
  then prints them to the terminal.
